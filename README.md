# GANs Using Keras
Training and Prediction of Images using Keras on MNIST dataset.

# Introduction

<p> This repository demonstrates the implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using the Keras framework. GANs are a powerful deep learning architecture that consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, competing against each other. The generator aims to create realistic fake data, such as images, while the discriminator tries to differentiate between real and fake data. Through a process of adversarial training, GANs can generate new data that closely resembles real data, opening up exciting possibilities in image generation, style transfer, and more. </p>
<p> I have used the MNIST dataset for this project. You can use it by just adding a line in the code 

   ```bash
    from keras.datasets import mnist
   ```
</p>
